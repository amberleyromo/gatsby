title: Gatsby.js Tutorial
---

Welcome to Gatsby! We’re glad you’re here. The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through setting up and deploying your first Gatsby site using a starter template. As we walk through that process, we’ll introduce some more general web development topics, and go over the underlying structure of a Gatsby site. 

The full tutorial is intended to be as accessible as possible to people without much web development experience (yet!) — no need to be an expert. If you prefer to jump straight to code, feel free to skip the step-by-step tutorial and see the [quick start](/docs/) page.

## Upcoming sections

0. [**Set up your development environment**](/tutorial/part-zero/): We’ll start by making sure you have installed all the tools you’ll need to begin development on a Gatsby site, and generate our very first site.
1. [**Familiarize with Gatsby building blocks**](//tutorial/part-one/). We’ll tour the code we’ve generated for our new Gatsby site and get introduced to the Gatsby project code structure.
2. [**Add styles to your site.**](/tutorial/part-two/) We’ll take a look at how we can start making changes to the presentational layer of the site by experimenting with styling.
3. [**Use layouts to build reusable site sections.**](/tutorial/part-three/) Using layouts makes the site-building less repetitive. Using self-contained components allows us to reuse them in different places on a site (like headers, footers, sidebars, etc). In this section, we’ll look deeper into what layouts are, and how we use them.

## Advanced tutorials

In these advanced tutorials, you'll learn how to pull data from almost anywhere into your Gatsby site with GraphQL.

4.  [Querying for data in a blog](/tutorial/part-four/): Create a blog and use a GraphQL query to pull your site title into the blog header.
5.  [Source plugins and rendering queried data](/tutorial/part-five/): Use a source plugin to pull Markdown blogposts into your site and create an index page with a list of blogposts.
6.  [Transformer plugins](/tutorial/part-six/): Use a transformer plugin to transform your Markdown blogposts into a form the blog can render.
7.  [Programmatically create pages from data](/tutorial/part-seven/): Learn how to programmatically create a set of pages for your blogposts.
